# Task-Manager
Full-stack app, NodeJS used as backend, and ReactJS used for the frontend

Instructions to Run the App
To get the app up and running,  follow a few simple steps for both the backend and frontend. Here's a clear, step-by-step guide:
-------------------------------------------------------
Database Setup
First, you need to configure the database connection.

1. Navigate to the database file at ./backend/util.
2. Open the file named dataBase.js.
3. Fill in the required credentials to connect to your database as instructed within the file.
-------------------------------------------------------
Starting the App
You'll need two separate terminals to start the frontend and backend servers.
-------------------------------------------------------
Frontend

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Run the command npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Once the installation is complete, run the command npm run dev. The frontend server will start, and its address will be displayed in the terminal.
-------------------------------------------------------
Backend

1. Leave the first terminal running and open a second terminal.
2. Navigate to the backend directory.
3. Run the command npm install to install the backend dependencies.
4. After the installation finishes, run the command npm start. You should see the message "server is live" in the terminal, confirming that the backend is running.
-------------------------------------------------------
If you've followed these steps correctly, the app should be live and ready for use.
